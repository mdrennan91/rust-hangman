# Overview

This project is a simple command-line Hangman game built in Rust. The purpose of this project is to improve my understanding of the Rust programming language by applying concepts like ownership, borrowing, pattern matching, and data structures in a real-world scenario.

I chose this project to push myself outside of the languages I'm more familiar with, and to get hands-on experience with a systems-level language known for its memory safety and performance.
